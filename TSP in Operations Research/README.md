Problem Statement:

ShipEx, a last-mile parcel carrier in Amherst, MA, is contemplating the integration of portable drones within their delivery trucks. The goal is to enhance efficiency in their delivery service. Given a data set covering five days, the challenges include:

1. Identifying which parcels (based on size, value, and recipient location) are suitable for drone delivery versus traditional truck delivery.
2. Assessing the geographical distribution of customer locations.
3. Evaluating the impact of implementing drone deliveries in terms of time, cost, and environmental effects.
4. Ensuring the accuracy of the provided data, especially travel times and distances.
5. Developing an optimized delivery policy that addresses demand fluctuations and effectively utilizes both vehicles and drones.
6. Presenting these findings in a comprehensive report and presentation for ShipEx, justifying recommendations and identifying future areas of study. 

The overarching aim is to determine the feasibility, benefits, and potential risks of incorporating drones into ShipEx's delivery operations.
