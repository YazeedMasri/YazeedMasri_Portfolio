# Yazeed_Portfolio
My data science portfolio
Hello!

Welcome to my data science portfolio.

My name is Yazeed Masri and I am currently a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I major in Operations and Information Management and Economics.

I created this portfolio to showcase my skills and interest in the field of data science. In my first project, I built a predictive model that was trained on Nvidia's stock price history. This project is a result of my interest in the field of financial technology. I enjoyed working with machine learning, data wrangling, and web scrapping libraries in this project and will continue to improve on my current skillset.
